The purpose of this program is to find the factorial of any positive integer that the user inputs. If a decimal is inputted, it will be rounded to the closest integer. If a negative number is put in, the program will omit the negative sign and just take the number itself, without the sign. However, when the user types in "quit", the program will automatically stop and wish the user a good day.
